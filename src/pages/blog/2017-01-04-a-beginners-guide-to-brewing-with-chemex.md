To make a decision for starting a business, an entrepreneur has to concentrate not only on the profit, competition and business growth, business cost, source of investment fund and quality of product and services but such entrepreneur must pay attention to knowledge on laws and regulations related to the business. Understanding of all the related laws and regulations will help the entrepreneur make a good business plan and be prepared in complying with all the requirements to both obtain benefit and to avoid any legal risks and damages. Generally, legal matters related to starting business to be considered are as follows:

_**Types of Business Unit**_

Types of business unit can vary from a sole proprietorship, limited partnership, company, and a public limited company, which requires at least fifteen shareholders. Each business unit has different legal status, management, relevant taxes, and others pros and cons. Therefore entrepreneurs should decide a suitable business unit according to the business objectives, business plan and limitations. General types of business unit are as follows:

1. **Sole Proprietorship**

A business unit of which the owner, as an individual, operates and manages everything, take profits and loss, and be liable solely. Such business unit shall be simply managed by its owner but will have limitation in implementing business plan, growth and credibility.

2. **Partnership**

A partnership is jointly established by at least 2 partners. It can be established as a non-juristic person partnership, which is not separated from its partners i.e. “an ordinary partnership”, or established as a new juristic person, which is separated from its partners i.e. “a registered ordinary partnership” and “a limited partnership”. Each type of partnership has different legal status, liability of partners and authorization of management etc.

3. **Limited Company**

A limited company is jointly established by at least 3 promoters (In the future, only one person will be able to establish a limited company). A limited company is a juristic person in separation from its shareholders. Liability of limited company will be limited by its registered capital which includes unpaid shares price of its shareholders. A limited company has more strict duties, as required by laws, than a partnership e.g. duties with respect to operation of a company, board meeting for approving legal actions of a company, high standard and complication of accounting and financial systems. This high standard of rules will ensure good internal control of a company and will result to its transparency and creditability.

4. **Public Limited Company**

Public limited companies (PLCs) are established under the requirements of having at least 15 shareholders and 5 board of directors, and not less than half of these board of directors must be domiciled in Thailand. PLCs have more legal requirements than a limited company. Moreover, public limited companies in the stock exchange must follow the regulations of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand (SEC) particularly having internal control system in place to ensure its transparency. The PLCs have key advantages on raising fund in stock market through selling shares to the public.

5. **Other business units**

Apart from this, there are other types of business units which have different legal status and suitability for one another, such as state enterprises, cooperatives, joint ventures, consortiums or multinational corporations that engage in business in the form of branch offices, distributors, regional offices or representative offices. These business types will have to follow the laws and regulations related to its nature.

_**Permissions or Registrations with respect to Businesses**_

**A. Permissions or Registrations in terms of Types of Core Business**

In various types of business, entrepreneurs must obtain permissions from or complete registration with the authorized government agencies prior to providing services, sale or production. This includes other proceedings related to providing services, sale or production e.g. importing, processing or exporting raw materials, parts and components, and other materials with respect to operation of their businesses.

Types of Businesses require permission and registration are insurance businesses, businesses related to alcohol beverage, online trades, cosmetics and pharmaceutics businesses, direct sales, manufacturing and trading products under industrial or sanitarian standards and other businesses that products or services may cause impacts to public etc.

Moreover, there are other additional permissions with respect to operation of businesses such as establishing factory, processing, importing or exporting hazardous substances etc.

**B. Permissions or Registrations in terms of Supporting Units of Business**

Apart from the permissions or registrations of types of core business, entrepreneurs are required to obtain permissions or proceed registrations with respect to supporting units of business such as work permits, registrations of employer and employee, social security registrations, value added tax (vat) registrations and registrations for use of cash registering machines.

**Conditions, Restrictions and Permissions for Foreign Businesses**

Foreign juristic persons under Thai laws are juristic persons which established under foreign laws or juristic persons which established under Thai laws with at least 51% of shares held by foreigners. There are some conditions and restrictions for foreign juristic persons which are different from Thai juristic persons.

**A. General Cases**

In general, persons, regardless of nationality, have freedom to conduct businesses. However, laws determine conditions or restrictions for a foreigner to engage in some types of business. A major law relating to this matter is Foreign Business Act B.E. 2542 which determines types of business that foreigners are restricted or required prior permissions for operating, as follows:

**List 1**: Businesses which are prohibited for operating by special reasons e.g. newspaper businesses, broadcasting businesses and fishery businesses in Thai territorial sea or exclusive economic zone of Thailand etc.

**List 2**: Businesses relating to safety and security of the country or impacting arts and cultures, traditions, folk handicraft or natural resources and environment such as manufacturing, trading and maintaining armaments, ships, aircrafts or military vehicles, and mining including exploding or breaking rocks etc.

**List 3**: Businesses which Thai person are not ready for competition such as accounting services, architectural services and advertising businesses etc.

In conclusion, laws prohibit foreigners to operate the businesses in List 1. The businesses in List 2 and List 3, foreigners must obtain permissions before operating. To obtain permissions to engage in the businesses in List 2 are more difficult than the businesses in the List 3 which, at present, there have been numbers of persons obtaining permissions to engage in such List 3 businesses.

Besides, laws provide privileges for foreigners from some countries under trade treaties between their countries and Thailand or foreigners who obtain investment promotion from The Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI), to operate businesses in Thailand without obtaining foreign business licenses.

**B. Businesses under the Investment Promotions of BOI**

Types of business under the BOI’s promotion and relevant privileges are prescribed by laws i.e. the Promotion Act and announcements of BOI. Such privileges include many types of business according to investment promotion policy and shall be altered for being suitable with each period. It seems that such privileges focus on businesses with respect to research and development, innovation, addition of value of agriculture, industry and service, promotion of small and medium enterprises, environmental friendly enterprises and energy saving or alternative energy enterprises, and other enterprises which affect development of economics and society of Thailand. Current types of promoted businesses are stated in announcements of BOI and a manual guide document of BOI which is available in BOI’s website (www.boi.go.th).

After obtaining the investment promotion, entrepreneurs will have to apply for a foreign business certificate from the Department of Business Development in order to be completely permitted to operate their businesses in Thailand. Applying for the foreign business certificate is less complicated than applying for a foreign business license as a general case.
